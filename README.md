# Advanced-Enterprise-network-management-design
Most modern organizations need a resilient, adaptive, and well-functioning network 
based on their needs as many persons depend on the solutions, they choose to assist 
them with a variety of daily tasks, network professionals who build these networks 
have important responsibilities. For the company to meet its goals and expectations, 
this article seeks to offer the ideal network architecture for NETWORKHATS
Enterprise. To achieve and satisfy the goals and requirements of the company, this 
paper will explain the ideal network architecture for NETWORKHATS Enterprise. This 
design is built on the Cisco Composite Enterprise Network Module. The company 
conducts operations in Pokhara in addition to its headquarters in Kathmandu. The six 
departments of administration, information technology, marketing, sales, support, and 
human resources are then divided among each building or office. Continuous data 
interchange, a variety of applications, and remote access to several facilities will 
necessitate a Local Area Network (LAN), a Wide Area Network (WAN), and remote 
access. The goal of LAN and WAN network design is to create a safe, quickly growing 
network that enables real-time data transmission and department-based access 
controls. The security, integrity, speed, and accessibility of data throughout the 
network, as well as the network's extensibility, must be taken into consideration while 
building the Network Topology for NETWORKHATS Pvt. Ltd. Different strategies were
implemented to construct a redundant network, since redundancy was also a crucial 
need for the Network Hats.
